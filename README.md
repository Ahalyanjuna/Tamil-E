This project aims to recognize and predict Tamil Brahmi characters from an image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras. The model segments individual characters in a given Tamil Brahmi script image and predicts the characters based on a pre-trained model. The predictions are then converted to Unicode characters.
